\section{Representation of finite groups}
In this report $\F_q$ indicates the finite field with $q=p^r$ elements, where $p$ is a prime and $r$ is an integer greater then zero.

Here we are interested in doing Fourier analysis on some subgroups of the \emph{General linear group}, which is defined below. 
\begin{defn}
	The {\it General Linear group} of dimension $n$ over the field $\F_q$ is the group of $n\times n$ invertible matrices with entries in $\F_q$:
	\begin{equation*}
	\GL(n,\F_q)=\Big\{ A \in \F_q^{n \times n} \colon \det A = \abs A\neq 0 \Big\}.
	\end{equation*}	
\end{defn}
In particular we will focus on $GL(2,\F_q)$ and on its subgroup $\Aff(q)$, \emph{i.e.} the \emph{Affine group}:
\begin{defn}
	The {\it Affine group} of dimension two over the field $\F_q$ is:
	\begin{equation*}
	\Aff (q)=\Big\{ A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\in \GL(2,\F_q) \Big\}=\Big\{ A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \colon a,b \in \F_q, \, a \neq 0 \Big \}.
	\end{equation*}
\end{defn}
Since we want to do Fourier analysis on these groups, first of all we must map them (homomorphically) into groups of complex matrices. To do that we need to introduce the concept of representation of finite group $G$.

\begin{defn}
A (finite dimensional) representation of a finite group $G$ is a group homomorphism
\[
\pi:  G \rightarrow \GL(n,\C).
\]
If, for $g\in G$, $\pi(g)$ is a matrix with $i,j$ entry $\pi_{i,j}(g)$, we call the functions $\pi_{i,j} : G \rightarrow \C$ the \emph{matrix entries} of $\pi$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
We can identify $\GL(n,\C)$ and
\[
\GL(V)=\{T\colon V\rightarrow V \ | \  T \text{ is linear and invertible}\},
\]
where $V$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\C$. However notice that in this case the matrix entries $\pi_{i,j}$ change if change the basis of $V$ and this can cause some issue. In any case, will use the two concepts interchangeably.
\end{rem}

We give now some important definition about representations. In the following $G$ indicates a finite group.
\begin{defn}
To representations $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of $G$ into $\GL(n,\C)$ are said to be \emph{equivalent}
if there exists a matrix $T \in \GL(n,\C)$ such that
\[
T\alpha(g)T^{-1}=\beta(g), \quad \forall g \in G.
\]
This is equivalent to say that we can obtain one representation from the other by a uniform change of basis.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{unitary} representation is a representation $\pi$ which maps $G$ into the unitary group $\U(n)$, where 
\[
\U(n) =\{A\in \GL(n,\C) \colon {}^{t}\!\bar{A}A=I\}.
\]
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
If $\Braket{u, \, v} = {}^t\!\bar{u}v$ is the standard Hermitian inner product of vectors of $\C^{n}$, the unitary matrices are those which preserve this product, that is, $\Braket{Au, \, Av} =\Braket{u, \, v} \ \forall u,v \in \C^{n}$.
Indeed, if $A \in \U(n)$, then by the definition of the inner product, we have $\Braket{Au, \, Av}={}^{t}\!\overline{(Au)}Av={}^t\!\bar{u}{}^t\!\bar{A}Av={}^t\!\bar{u}v=\Braket{u,\, v} \ \forall u,v \in \C^{n}$ and vice versa if $\Braket{Au, \, Av} =\Braket{u, \, v} \ \forall u,v \in \C^{n}$ then, by taking $u_i=(0,\dots ,0, 1, 0,\dots , 0)$ where the $1$ is in the $i$-$th$ coordinate, we see that, indicating with $a_i$ the $i$-$th$ column of $A$, $\delta_{i,j}=\langle u_i, \, u_j\rangle =\langle Au_i, \, Au_j\rangle={}^t\!\bar{a_i}a_j$, that is ${}^{t}\!\bar{A}A=I$.
\end{rem}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{subrepresentation} $\rho$ of a representation $\pi\colon G \rightarrow \GL(V)$ means that $\rho\colon G \rightarrow \GL(W)$, where $W$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $\pi(g)W\subset W \text{ for all }g \in G$ and $\rho(g)$ is the restriction of $\pi(g)$ to $W$, \it{i.e.}
\[
\pi(g)_{\mkern 1mu \vrule height 2ex\mkern2mu W}= \rho(g)\ \forall g \in G
\]
Using matrix language, this means that there is a basis of $V$ such that $\pi(g)$ has the block form:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\rho(g) & \ast \ \\
0 & \ast \
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
A representation  $\pi$ is \emph{irreducible} if its only subrepresentations are $\pi$ itself and 0.
\end{defn}
When we deal with representations of a finite group $G$, we can just consider the unitary ones, due to the following result:
\begin{prop}
If $G$ is a finite group, every representation is equivalent to a unitary representation.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch.]
To prove this preposition we'll use the fact (which we aren't going to prove) that if a matrix $M$ leaves invariant some positive definite, Hermitian inner product $c(u,v)$ for $u,v \in \C^n$, then $M$ is conjugate to a unitary matrix.
So it suffices to find an inner product which is invariant under $\pi(g)$ for all $g \in G$. Such a inner product is given by 
\[
c(u,v)= \sum_{g \in G} \Braket{ \pi(g)u, \pi(g)v } , \text{ for } u,v \in \C^n.
\]
Indeed, for $h\in G$, $u,v\in \C^n$, we have
%\begin{fleqn}
\[
\begin{split}
c(\pi(h)u,\pi(h)v) &= \sum_{g \in G} \Braket{ \pi(g)\pi(h)u, \pi(g)\pi(h)v } \\
&=\sum_{g \in G} \Braket{ \pi(gh)u, \pi(gh)v } \\
&=\sum_{k \in G} \Braket{ \pi(k)u, \pi(k)v }= c(u,v).\\
\end{split}
\]
%\end{fleqn}
Where we have made the substitution $gh=k$, so that if $h$ runs through all the elements in $G$, so does $k$. 
\end{proof}
Let us now introduce  the space of functions from $G$ to $\C$ 
\begin{equation*}
\LL^2(G)=\Set{f\colon G \rightarrow \C},
\end{equation*}
which is a vector space over $\C$ of dimension $\abs G$ (it is isomorphic to $\C^n$, with $n=\abs G$).
We can make $\LL^2(G)$ an algebra by defining the \emph{convolution} $a\ast b$, for $a,b\in \LL^2(G)$, $x\in G$:
\begin{equation*}
(a\ast b)(x)=\sum_{t \in G} a(xt^{-1})b(t)=\sum_{y \in G} a(y)b(y^{-1}x)
\end{equation*}
\begin{rem}[non necessario]
This definition of convolution coincides with that given for the commutative group $\Z/{n\Z}$ ($(a\ast b)(x)=\sum_{y \in \Z/{n\Z}} a(y)b(x-y)$). 
Moreover we have that, given $f\in \LL^2(G)$,
\begin{equation}
\label{conv:comm}
f*h=h*f \quad \forall h \in \LL^2(G)
\end{equation}

if and only if $f$ is constant on conjugacy classes
\[
\Set{g}=\Set{xgx^{-1}\colon x\in G}.
\]
Indeed if $f$ is constant on conjugacy classes, then for all $x\in G$
\[
\begin{split}
(f\ast h)(x) &=\sum_{t \in G} f(xt^{-1})h(t)\\
&=\sum_{xt \in G} f(x(xt)^{-1})h(xt)\\
&=\sum_{xt \in G} f(xt^{-1}x^{-1})h(xt)\\
&=\sum_{xt \in G} f(t^{-1})h(xt)\\
&=\sum_{y \in G} f(y^{-1}x)h(y)= (h*f)(x),
\end{split}
\]
and, conversely, if \ref{conv:comm} holds, then, taking $h=\delta_k$, for $k\in G$, we have that $(f\ast h)(ky)=f(kyk^{-1})$ and $(h*f)(ky)=f(y)$ for all $y \in G$, so that $f$ is constant on conjugacy classes.
Since if $G$ is commutative the conjugacy class $\{g\}$ contains only $g$, it follows that the convolution is commutative for abelian groups, as we already know.

\begin{ex}
We define the \emph{Left Regular Representation} $\LL$ of $G$ by 
\begin{align*}
\LL\colon G &\rightarrow \GL(\LL^2(G))\\
		 g&\mapsto \LL(g) 
\end{align*}
